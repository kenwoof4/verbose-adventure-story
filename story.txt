A young man named John walked into a bar. John was an attorney more specifically a criminal attorny, he 
had just got off a court hearing defending a serial killer. He took off his black leather jacket and
let out a sigh. His mind twisting and confused. He didnt know why he was
defending a killer but he had no choice, it was his job. The bartender sees John 
and gives him a free pint, John nodded his head, then he put a 5 dollar note into the tip jar. He chugged down the pint and left without another word.

John feared he did to well. The prosecutor was a novice. He may have set a killer free.
That night he didn't sleep well. In his dream he saw all victims' family were shouting at him. But he couldn't hear what they are saying.
Suddenly he saw that killer he was defending. The killer saw him as well. He turn around and started walking toward John, smiling.
John woke up, full of sweat on his body. He realized that someone was knocking at his door.

John frantically woke up and rushed to the door. He was scared for his life. His body was shivering yet he was dripping of sweat. He slowly
said, "Who's there?". No one replied. He peeped through the eyehole in the door hoping to catch a glimpse of the visitor. A gun barrel filled the 
space. He realized this was it. "Open the door. NOW." John ran to the back of the room. He was ready for this moment. He grabbed the shotgun
from the suitcase and fired 3 shots through the door. This was it. He opened the door but no one was there. It was all in his head again. He was
losing his mind.
