A young man named John walked into a bar. John was an attorney more specifically a criminal attorny, he 
had just got off a court hearing defending a serial killer. He took off his black leather jacket and
let out a sigh. His mind twisting and confused. He didnt know why he was
defending a killer but he had no choice, it was his job. The bartender sees John 
and gives him a free pint, John nodded his head, then he put a 5 dollar note into the tip jar. He chugged down the pint and left without another word.
