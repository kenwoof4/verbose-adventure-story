A young man named John walked into a bar. John was an attorney more specifically a criminal attorny, he 
had just got off a court hearing defending a serial killer. He took off his black leather jacket and
let out a sigh. His mind twisting and confused. He didnt know why he was
defending a killer but he had no choice, it was his job. The bartender sees John 
and gives him a free pint, John nodded his head, then he put a 5 dollar note into the tip jar. He chugged down the pint and left without another word.

John feared he did to well. The prosecutor was a novice. He may have set a killer free.
That night he didn't sleep well. In his dream he saw all victims' family were shouting at him. But he couldn't hear what they are saying.
Suddenly he saw that killer he was defending. The killer saw him as well. He turn around and started walking toward John, smiling.
John woke up, full of sweat on his body. He realized that someone was knocking at his door.
